# ChefConnect
*Mamma Mia! Connecting Tastebuds and Talent!*

ChefConnect was created by Sahil Chowdhury, Jayanth Pandit, Sohan Subudhi, and Aarushi Lakhi. After realizing how much they missed home-cooked food in college, they decided to create a product to serve as a platform that facilitates a connection between individuals who are looking for home-cooked meals and those who aspire to become chefs or have a passion for cooking and would like to make money from it.
